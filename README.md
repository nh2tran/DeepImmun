# DeepImmun
## Predicting immunogenicity by modeling the positive and negative selection of CD8+ T cells in individual patients

Training, prediction and evaluation can be performed by following the step-by-step instructions in the Python notebook `aa.tcell_github_20221221.ipynb`. The notebook was tested with Python 3.8 and TensorFlow 2.6.

The pre-trained models, training, and evaluation data can be downloaded from the following link:
